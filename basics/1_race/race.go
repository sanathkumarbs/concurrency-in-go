// A race condition occurs when two or more operations must

// Most of the time, this shows up in whatâ€™s called a data race,
// where one concurrent operation attempts to read a variable
// while at some undetermined time another concurrent operation
// is attempting to write to the same variable.

// Use go run -race race.go to see how go detects Data Race
